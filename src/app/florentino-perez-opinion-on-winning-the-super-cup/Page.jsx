                <p>It is not easy to debut at Real Madrid with a goal and Mbappe has made a very good start, added the president after picking up his 64th title at the helm of the club.</p>
                <p>President Florentino Perez was interviewed by Real Madrid TV after winning the European Super Cup in Warsaw: I am very happy. We are just starting the season, it is the first title we have won and this is going to encourage us to do our best. it would give us energy for a season that, as we all know, is going to be very difficult.</p>
                <h1>Mbappes Debut</h1>
                <p>The fact that Mbappe made his debut in a Real Madrid shirt by scoring is going to give him a lot of confidence to have a good season. He is very happy. When he picked up his medal he was happy. It is not easy to make your Real Madrid debut with a goal and he has made a great start. </p>
                <h1>The match</h1>
                <p>In the second half we came out to win. We scored two goals and we could have scored more. When you go out to win with that impetus and that strength. It is normal that we win.</p>
                <h1>64 titles as President</h1>
                <p>I am excited about everything we can do. We have to keep working hard like we did last year and we will reap the rewards. We have a great team and nobody doubts that.</p>
                <h1>Madridstas</h1>
                <p>I have just come back from the United States, where they were amazing, as they were here. Real Madrid is universal. Fans all over the world have the club in their hearts and we can see that every time we leave Spain.</p> */}
